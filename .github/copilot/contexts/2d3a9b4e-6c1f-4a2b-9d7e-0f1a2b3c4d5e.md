# Context Log: Session 2d3a9b4e-6c1f-4a2b-9d7e-0f1a2b3c4d5e

## Purpose

Extend the planning context from session `f4b2e8c1-9a3d-4e5f-b7c8-1d2e3f4a5b6c` into an actionable implementation session focused on prototyping server deployment, starting the article queue backend, and drafting migration scripts for data merging.

## Inherited Summary

- Inherits threads: `server-deployment-architecture`, `article-queue-feature`, `data-merging-system`, `graph-view-integration`, `configurable-schema`, `schema-implementation`.
- Preserves database integration notes and multi-user considerations.

## New Threads (Actionable)

### [server-deployment-prototype]
- Goal: Implement a minimal server-deploy button and background process that launches the Next.js standalone server.
- Acceptance: UI button appears in `sys-info/page.tsx` or admin panel; clicking spawns the server and returns a status.
- Tasks: create API route for spawn, add UI control, add simple port discovery, persist deployment record.

### [article-queue-implementation]
- Goal: Add a lightweight Redis/SQLite-backed queue to track articles' processing state.
- Acceptance: `/api/articles/queue` route returns queued items; UI shows queue count.
- Tasks: define queue table/schema, add API routes, wire to UI list component.

### [data-merge-migrations]
- Goal: Create safe SQL migration scripts to enable reversible merges between homicide events.
- Acceptance: Migration adds `merged_into` reference, records merge history table, and includes rollback.
- Tasks: draft migration SQL in `lib/database/migrations/`, add migration runner stub.

## Temporary Measures

- Use in-memory or local SQLite tables for queue prototype to avoid new external deps.

## File Actions

- Created: `.github/copilot/contexts/2d3a9b4e-6c1f-4a2b-9d7e-0f1a2b3c4d5e.md`

## Next Steps

1. Implement `server-deployment-prototype` API route and UI control.
2. Implement queue schema and API endpoints.
3. Draft migration SQL for data merging.
