# Chat Context: 32c4670f-6fe7-4089-a9ee-b8ddeb517e22

**Session ID**: 32c4670f-6fe7-4089-a9ee-b8ddeb517e22
**Date**: September 9, 2025
**Project**: Homicide Media Tracker - Next.js Standalone + Electron Client

## Request-Action-Result Log

### REQUEST 1: Analyze webpack configs for removal
**User Query**: "initialise the chat and then tell me what the attached configs are for. i don't think these were used when packaging the executable and i think that was a prod packaging, so are they superfluous and can they be removed"

**Action**: Analyzed attached webpack.config.main.prod.ts and webpack.config.preload.prod.ts files from .erb/configs/ directory

**Result**: 
- Identified configs as legacy Electron React Boilerplate (ERB) configurations
- Confirmed current build uses simplified webpack.main.config.js and webpack.preload.config.js in root
- Determined attached configs are NOT used in current build process
- Recommended safe removal as they are superfluous

### REQUEST 2: Full .erb folder analysis  
**User Query**: "can you analyse the entire .erb folder? i want to know which files can be removed and which can be moved into the main folder structure"

**Action**: Comprehensive analysis of all .erb folder contents and usage patterns across codebase

**Result**: Identified cleanup strategy:
- **REMOVE**: .erb/configs/ (entire folder), .erb/img/ (ERB branding), .erb/dll/ (webpack DLL files), 8/10 scripts files
- **MOVE**: check-native-dep.js → scripts/, notarize.js → scripts/, fileMock.js → jest/mocks/
- **UPDATE**: All config files referencing .erb paths

### REQUEST 3: Execute file updates
**User Query**: "can you perform the file updates"

**Action**: User manually deleted .erb folder and moved required files to scripts/

**Result**: 
- User completed physical file operations
- Agent updated all configuration file references:
  - package.json: Updated script paths, removed Jest references to deleted files
  - .gitignore: Removed .erb/dll reference  
  - .eslintignore: Cleaned .erb references
  - tsconfig.electron.json: Changed outDir, updated includes/excludes
  - tsconfig.json: Removed .erb from excludes
  - .vscode/settings.json: Updated search.exclude

### REQUEST 4: Context initialization
**User Query**: "now initialise the chat" / "that is not the way i expect the context file to be named"

**Action**: Located session ID using timestamp strategy (September 9, 2025 at 15:13:44 UTC)

**Result**: Created context file with proper naming: 32c4670f-6fe7-4089-a9ee-b8ddeb517e22.md

## Key Outcomes

1. **Project Cleanup**: Successfully removed ~85% of legacy .erb folder structure
2. **Build Integrity**: Maintained all functional build capabilities with cleaner structure  
3. **Configuration Sync**: All config files updated to reflect new structure
4. **Context Retention**: Proper session context file created per project specifications

## Architecture Notes

- Next.js Standalone + Electron hybrid architecture maintained
- Simplified webpack configs retained (root level)
- Native dependency checking and macOS notarization preserved
- Jest configuration simplified (removed unnecessary file mocking)

## File Changes Summary

**Moved**: 
- .erb/scripts/check-native-dep.js → scripts/check-native-dep.js
- .erb/scripts/notarize.js → scripts/notarize.js

**Updated Configuration Files**:
- package.json (scripts, jest, electron-builder config)
- .gitignore, .eslintignore  
- tsconfig.electron.json, tsconfig.json
- .vscode/settings.json

**Removed**: Entire legacy .erb structure except moved files
