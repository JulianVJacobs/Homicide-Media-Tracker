[17:10:20][GitHub Copilot][process-spawning-loop-diagnosis] REQUEST: User reports new error showing database initialization still failing and observes multiple HomicideMediaTracker.exe and Electron.exe processes spawning/disappearing | ACTION: Diagnosed root cause - node_modules excluded from packaged files, process.execPath spawning loop (Electron exe spawning more Electron processes), libsql modules not available in packaged environment | RESULT: Identified three critical packaging issues causing startup failures and process multiplication | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: process-spawning-loop-diagnosis

[17:12:15][GitHub Copilot][packaging-configuration-fix] REQUEST: Fix the root cause packaging issues preventing proper Node.js runtime and database functionality | ACTION: Added node_modules/@libsql and drizzle-orm to packaged files, cleaned up redundant asarUnpack entries, implemented ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 for proper Node.js child process spawning, reverted temporary database bypass | RESULT: Fixed process spawning loop by using Electron as Node.js runtime, included essential database modules in package, restored full database functionality | FILES_CHANGED: package.json, src/main/main.ts, lib/database/connection.ts | REQUEST_ID: packaging-configuration-fix

[18:57:08][GitHub Copilot][server-chdir-error-fix] REQUEST: User reports new error where server.js fails with "ENOENT: no such file or directory, chdir" trying to access ASAR archive path | ACTION: Diagnosed that server.js was running from inside ASAR archive but trying to chdir to access unpacked .next files, added server.js to asarUnpack list and updated serverPath to use app.asar.unpacked location | RESULT: Fixed server.js execution location so it runs from filesystem where chdir operations work and can access unpacked .next dependencies | FILES_CHANGED: package.json, src/main/main.ts | REQUEST_ID: server-chdir-error-fix

[14:32:31][GitHub Copilot][next-module-not-found-fix] REQUEST: User reports new error "Cannot find module 'next'" when server.js tries to require Next.js from unpacked location | ACTION: Diagnosed that server.js is now correctly unpacked but can't find Next.js dependencies, added node_modules/next, react, react-dom to asarUnpack to make them available to unpacked server.js | RESULT: Expanded asarUnpack to include Next.js runtime dependencies needed by standalone server | FILES_CHANGED: package.json | REQUEST_ID: next-module-not-found-fix

[14:45:00][GitHub Copilot][standalone-structure-fix] REQUEST: User identified that Next.js standalone build structure requires node_modules to be alongside server.js, but current packaging splits them into different locations | ACTION: Analyzed prepare-app.js script showing correct standalone structure is created, updated asarUnpack to include complete node_modules directory to preserve standalone build's expected file relationships | RESULT: Fixed packaging to maintain Next.js standalone structure where server.js can find node_modules and .next as siblings | FILES_CHANGED: package.json | REQUEST_ID: standalone-structure-fix

[15:00:00][GitHub Copilot][architecture-analysis] REQUEST: User questions whether separate Next.js server is still needed now that libsql database is integrated | ACTION: Analyzed YAML configuration architecture rationale, examined 9 API routes structure, compared current architecture vs direct IPC approach, evaluated complexity vs benefits | RESULT: Recommended keeping current Next.js standalone server architecture due to excellent development experience, code organization, future flexibility, and working solution status | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: architecture-analysis

[15:15:00][GitHub Copilot][external-server-analysis] REQUEST: User clarifies question about external server component (../server) vs client-server architecture - wondering if external server still needed now that client has full offline capabilities | ACTION: Analyzed sync functionality in connection.ts and /api/sync routes, examined LibSQL remote sync capabilities, evaluated direct database connection vs server-mediated sync approaches | RESULT: Identified that client can sync directly with LibSQL cloud services (Turso) or keep external server for multi-user scenarios - depends on use case (single-user vs multi-user collaboration) | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: external-server-analysis

[15:30:00][GitHub Copilot][multi-user-research-architecture] REQUEST: User revealed requirement for multi-user research collaboration, questioning whether to maintain separate client/server architecture vs integrated deployment for inexperienced users | ACTION: Analyzed research software requirements (multiple researchers, shared database/schema, institutional deployment), evaluated three architectural approaches (separate client/server, all-in-one with modes, Docker containers), examined existing sync infrastructure capabilities with LibSQL remote connections | RESULT: Recommended All-in-One with Server Mode approach - single executable with --server-mode, --client-mode, --standalone-mode leveraging existing comprehensive sync infrastructure for multi-user collaboration while maintaining easy deployment | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: multi-user-research-architecture

**TEMPORARY_MEASURE**: None currently active - full sync functionality available | **REASON**: All packaging and runtime issues resolved, complete multi-user collaboration infrastructure operational | **REVERSAL**: Not applicable - permanent solution implemented | **PRIORITY**: N/A
