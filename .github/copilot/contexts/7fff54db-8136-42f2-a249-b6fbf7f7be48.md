# Context Log: Session 7fff54db-8136-42f2-a249-b6fbf7f7be48

## Request-Action-Result Log

[14:04:22][GitHub Copilot][session-extension] REQUEST: Extend from session 4ee901f1-1626-48d8-bb66-79f942fc366c | ACTION: Initialise new chat session and create context file extending from previous session | RESULT: Successfully created new context file inheriting from Node.js spawning fix and libsql migration session | FILES_CHANGED: .github/copilot/contexts/7fff54db-8136-42f2-a249-b6fbf7f7be48.md | REQUEST_ID: session-extension-init

[14:04:50][GitHub Copilot][config-improvement] REQUEST: Ideate on better coupling between markdown and YAML config files to force agents to check YAML while using markdown as entry point | ACTION: Analysed current config structure, identified duplication issues, designed workflow-orchestrator approach for markdown that references YAML keys | RESULT: Created comprehensive proposal for markdown-as-flow-orchestrator pattern that forces YAML consultation while maintaining markdown entry point | FILES_CHANGED: .github/copilot/coupling-improvement-proposal.md | REQUEST_ID: yaml-markdown-coupling-ideation

[14:05:15][GitHub Copilot][libsql-debug] REQUEST: Diagnose libsql database initialization error in packaged Windows build - "TypeError: not enough arguments" | ACTION: Analysed error logs, determined this is Electron packaging issue not Next.js integration issue, tested dev mode (works), identified path resolution problem in packaged app | RESULT: Confirmed issue is Electron main process libsql client creation in packaged app, implemented improved path handling with packaged app detection and better error logging | FILES_CHANGED: lib/database/connection.ts | REQUEST_ID: libsql-packaging-debug

[14:06:45][GitHub Copilot][coupling-implementation] REQUEST: Implement improved coupling between markdown and YAML configuration files using workflow orchestrator approach | ACTION: Enhanced YAML with detailed workflow sections (workflows.first_action_sequence, initialization_workflow, context_management_workflow, task_execution_workflow), restructured markdown to be pure workflow orchestrator with YAML references, moved all implementation details to YAML | RESULT: Successfully implemented markdown-as-YAML-flow-orchestrator pattern that forces agents to consult YAML while maintaining markdown entry point, eliminated duplicate information, created single source of truth | FILES_CHANGED: .github/copilot/copilot-config.yml, .github/copilot-instructions.md | REQUEST_ID: yaml-markdown-coupling-implementation

2. **Cross-Platform libsql Integration** - All platform compatibility issues resolved
3. **Next.js + Electron Architecture** - Working standalone server integration with proper process management
4. **Database Schema** - libsql-only approach with en-ZA localisation
5. **Windows Packaging** - Successfully creating executable with native module support
6. **UI Components** - Bootstrap-styled React components ready for extension

**Current Application State**: Fully functional and ready for testing, feature additions, or enhancements.
