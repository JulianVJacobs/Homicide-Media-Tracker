GOOD DAY
This is data Readme. In this Readme all the CSV files and excel files that are present will be talked and the CSV file used to input data into the tables will be mentioned

EXCEL FORMATED FILE 
1. Sample Data Homicide Tracker _EDIT.xlsx -- This is the first excel file with homicide data we got for the project. We got this file from Max Brenner who worked on this project as part of his Vac work. This excel file only had 5 murders which were covered 307 times by different by different news platform

2. Femicide in media 2012-2013 sample data for homicide tracker.xlsx -- This is the second excel file with femicide data we got for the project. This was given to us by Dr. Nechama Brodie when we requested to get more data for the project. The excel file had around 357 unique murders reported around 4052 times by different news platform and media outlets. This data was also not cleaned and very badly recorded. Cleaning this data to use on open day and to test the dashboard took around 70 hours 

3. Homicide_media_cleaned_data.xlsx -- This is the cleaned version of the Femicide in media 2012-2013 sample data for homicide tracker.xlsx file. In this file, the data is cleaned and well maintained so that it can be used to dashboard to create meaningful data visualisation. It took 70 hours to make this excel file usable for the dashboard's data visualisations.

CSV FORMATED FILE
1. Open_day_data.csv -- This CSV file was created using the Homicide_media_cleaned_data.xlsx. This CSV file is uploaded on to the open_day_homicide_data table as an input. The data from the file is used for Data visualisations and tables for open day

2. homicide_news_data.csv -- This CSV file was created using the Sample Data Homicide Tracker _EDIT.xlsx. As this is the first sample of data given to us. Therefore, it was used to create that homicide_news table and the data from this CSV file was uploaded on the homicide_news table as an input for testing. 

This is all the data we used in project and is processed.
Thank you
