# Context Log: Session f4b2e8c1-9a3d-4e5f-b7c8-1d2e3f4a5b6c

## Request-Action-Result Log

[12:00:00][GitHub Copilot][session-extension] REQUEST: Extend from session 863131e7-7fce-41e7-b6b8-0b44263c64bd and start feature development threads | ACTION: Created new session context extending from parent with comprehensive context inheritance, initiated multiple feature threads for advanced system capabilities | RESULT: New session established with inherited homicide media tracker context including libsql integration, multi-user architecture, and all resolved packaging issues | FILES_CHANGED: .github/copilot/contexts/f4b2e8c1-9a3d-4e5f-b7c8-1d2e3f4a5b6c.md | REQUEST_ID: session-extension-feature-threads

## Thread Initialisations

### [server-deployment-architecture] Thread Analysis
**CONCEPT**: Replace "mode selection" with on-click server deployment functionality where current application can always be deployed as server, with access controls managed from application itself.

**ARCHITECTURAL FEASIBILITY**: Highly feasible based on existing infrastructure:
- Current application already has complete Next.js standalone server capability
- LibSQL sync infrastructure supports multi-user scenarios
- Existing process spawning system can be extended for server deployment
- Access control can leverage existing database schema with user management

**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**:
1. Server deployment button in application UI
2. Server mode detection and automatic configuration
3. Access control management through database
4. Dynamic port assignment and service discovery
5. User role and permission system

### [article-queue-feature] Thread Analysis
**CONCEPT**: Article processing queue system to streamline user workflow for annotation and data collection.

**REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS**:
- Queue management interface
- Article prioritisation system
- Processing state tracking (unprocessed, in-progress, completed, requires-review)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Integration with existing homicide data schema

**UI/UX CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Queue dashboard with filterable article list
- Drag-and-drop prioritisation
- Quick annotation tools
- Progress indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient processing

### [data-merging-system] Thread Analysis
**CONCEPT**: System for merging unrelated cases that are discovered to be related.

**DATABASE IMPLICATIONS**:
- Relationship tracking between homicide events
- Audit trail for merge operations
- Data integrity preservation during merges
- Conflict resolution for overlapping data
- Reversible merge operations

**SCHEMA CONSIDERATIONS** (based on attached diagram):
- Many-to-many relationships between homicide events
- Merge history tracking
- Data provenance maintenance
- Reference integrity across related tables

### [graph-view-integration] Thread Analysis
**CONCEPT**: Visual graph representation of connections between data entities.

**VISUALISATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- Node-link diagrams for entity relationships
- Interactive exploration capabilities
- Filtering and search within graph
- Export capabilities for research presentation
- Integration with existing Chart.js infrastructure

**DATA RELATIONSHIPS** (from schema):
- Homicide events as primary nodes
- Victim, perpetrator, and media connections
- Geographic and temporal clustering
- Cross-case relationship visualisation

### [configurable-schema] Thread Analysis
**CONCEPT**: Configurable data fields requiring potential table recreation.

**DATABASE MIGRATION STRATEGY**:
- Schema versioning system
- Data preservation during schema changes
- Field type configuration interface
- Table recreation with data migration
- Rollback capabilities for schema changes

**IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Dynamic form generation based on schema
- Type validation for custom fields
- Migration scripts for schema evolution
- Backup and restore functionality

### [schema-implementation] Thread Analysis
**REFERENCE**: Attached primary schema diagram showing homicide event relationships.

**IDENTIFIED ENTITIES**:
- Homicide Event (central entity with unique ID)
- News Reports (multiple per event, unique IDs)
- Incident Data (victim details, perpetrator info, location, timing)
- Media Metadata (publication details, journalist info, URLs)
- Relationship tracking between entities

**SCHEMA ALIGNMENT**:
- Current database schema requires alignment with attached diagram
- Many-to-many relationships between events and reports
- Comprehensive victim and perpetrator tracking
- Geographic and temporal data structure
- Media source tracking and metadata
