## Request-Action-Result Log

[09:08:50][claude-sonnet-4][context-retention] REQUEST: Follow instructions in intialise-chat.prompt.md | ACTION: file_search, read_file, grep_search, run_in_terminal, create_file | RESULT: Located session data, parsed copilot-config.yml format, extracted metadata, creating context log | FILES_CHANGED: /workspace/.github/copilot/contexts/d741770d-af52-416c-8a88-74006805a9c7.md | REQUEST_ID: request_fdff1deb-29ab-4b49-afc3-0cac92c8d9a2

[09:10:15][claude-sonnet-4][portable-executable-issue] REQUEST: Recall outcome of portable executable run | ACTION: semantic_search, grep_search, read_file for previous session data | RESULT: Found configuration but no specific previous error records | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: request_portable_recall

[09:15:30][claude-sonnet-4][axios-dependency-fix] REQUEST: Fix "cannot find module axios" error in portable executable | ACTION: read_file(main.ts), read_file(webpack.main.config.js), replace_string_in_file | RESULT: Removed unused axios from webpack externals - axios was removed from main.ts but still listed in webpack config | FILES_CHANGED: /workspace/webpack.main.config.js | REQUEST_ID: request_axios_fix

[09:20:45][claude-sonnet-4][build-directory-issue] REQUEST: Fix build error - Couldn't find pages or app directory | ACTION: identified wrong working directory (.next/standalone instead of project root), run_in_terminal from correct location | RESULT: Build completed successfully - Next.js build, main process, preload, and app preparation all passed | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: request_build_fix

[09:25:15][claude-sonnet-4][windows-executable-build] REQUEST: Build Windows executable instead of Linux AppImage | ACTION: identified package:win script, initiated Windows build, improved script naming for clarity | RESULT: Running package:windows-portable build, updated script names to be more descriptive | FILES_CHANGED: /workspace/package.json | REQUEST_ID: request_windows_build

[09:28:30][claude-sonnet-4][package-script-improvement] REQUEST: Make package script build for all platforms | ACTION: updated package script to build all platforms, added package:all alias | RESULT: package now builds Windows+macOS+Linux, platform-specific scripts available for targeted builds | FILES_CHANGED: /workspace/package.json | REQUEST_ID: request_package_all

[09:32:15][claude-sonnet-4][wsl-filesystem-issue] REQUEST: Address electron-builder I/O error with d3dcompiler_47.dll in WSL | ACTION: identified WSL filesystem permission issue during cleanup phase | RESULT: User will manually delete problematic directory, deferring WSL permissions troubleshooting | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: request_wsl_cleanup

[09:35:30][claude-sonnet-4][electron-error-handling-thread] REQUEST: Explore options for handling uncaught errors to prevent zombie processes | ACTION: analyzed current error handling, outlined 5 different approaches with pros/cons | RESULT: Provided comprehensive error handling strategies - process handlers, graceful shutdown, dev vs prod behavior, recovery options | FILES_CHANGED: none | REQUEST_ID: request_error_handling_analysis

[09:40:15][claude-sonnet-4][nsis-wsl-issue] REQUEST: Fix NSIS makensis failure when building Windows executable in WSL | ACTION: identified WSL/NSIS compatibility issue, changed Windows target from 'portable' to 'dir' to avoid NSIS | RESULT: Modified build config to bypass NSIS installer creation, building win-unpacked directory instead | FILES_CHANGED: /workspace/package.json | REQUEST_ID: request_nsis_workaround

[09:42:30][claude-sonnet-4][single-executable-future-thread] REQUEST: Acknowledge preference for single executable over directory distribution | ACTION: documented requirement for future improvement thread | RESULT: THREAD_CREATED - single executable preferred over win-unpacked directory, workaround is temporary solution, investigate portable exe alternatives to NSIS for WSL compatibility | FILES_CHANGED: context log | REQUEST_ID: request_single_exe_thread
